What is ADS-B Display? 

A simple web app designed for flight schools. The User inputs the planes they want to track. The app uses publicly available flight data to draw the desired planes on a map.  

Why Use ADS-B Display? 

Apps like FlightAware are great for tracking a single plane but don’t have the customization needed for a Flight School: hard or impossible to track multiple planes at a time, no details on which planes are landed, can’t center on a desired location (the flight school’s home airport), cluttered maps and interfaces, apps timeout unless you pay, won’t save anything when you close the website.  

This app is designed solely for flight schools and gives the information and options that a Flight school would need.
